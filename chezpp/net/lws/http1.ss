  #|proc:make-lws-http1-client
The `make-lws-http1-client` procedure creates a reactor-backed HTTP/1 client transport.
`event-capacity`, `payload-capacity`, and `command-capacity` bound native and reactor pools.
`tls-context-handle` is zero or a native TLS context. `proxy-address` and `proxy-port` select the
immutable proxy policy for the transport.
The return value is an internal transport client.

  #|proc:lws-http1-request/nonblocking
The `lws-http1-request/nonblocking` procedure starts normalized request record `request` on
`client`. `response-sink` is `#f` or a write/finish procedure vector. The optional `ready`
procedure is called when an HTTP/2 connection has completed stream migration. The return value is
a `net-operation` completing with a transport response record.
