  #|proc:net-operation?
The `net-operation?` procedure reports whether `value` is a network operation.
The `value` parameter may be any Scheme object.
The return value is `#t` for a network operation and `#f` otherwise.
|#
  (define net-operation?
    (lambda (value)
      (pcheck ()
              (%net-operation? value))))

  #|proc:make-net-operation
The `make-net-operation` procedure constructs a pending network operation of `kind`.
The `kind` parameter is a symbol identifying the operation.
The `advance` parameter has signature `() -> operation-update` and must never block.
The `cancel` parameter has signature `() -> unspecified` and cancels pending native work.
The optional `cleanup` parameter has signature `() -> unspecified` and releases resources.
The return value is a new pending network operation. Omitting `cleanup` uses `void`.

  #|proc:net-operation-state
The `net-operation-state` procedure returns the lifecycle state of `operation`.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation.
The return value is `pending`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

  #|proc:net-operation-poll-targets
The `net-operation-poll-targets` procedure returns the current poll targets of `operation`.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation.
The return value is a list of poll targets, empty when no descriptor readiness is required.

  #|proc:net-operation-deadline-ms
The `net-operation-deadline-ms` procedure returns the absolute deadline of `operation`.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation.
The return value is monotonic milliseconds or `#f` when there is no deadline.
|#

  #|proc:net-operation-remaining-timeout-ms
The `net-operation-remaining-timeout-ms` procedure computes the poll timeout for `operation`.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation with an optional absolute deadline.
The return value is `-1` without a deadline, or a nonnegative fixnum of milliseconds remaining.

  #|proc:net-operation-step!
The `net-operation-step!` procedure advances pending `operation` once without waiting.
The `operation` parameter is a pending network operation.
The return value is the same operation after its state and readiness metadata are updated.
Conditions from advancement or cleanup are stored as a failed result.

  #|proc:net-operation-cancel!
The `net-operation-cancel!` procedure cancels pending `operation` and cleans it up once.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation in any lifecycle state.
The return value is the same operation. Repeated cancellation of a terminal operation is inert.
If cancellation or cleanup fails, the first callback condition becomes a failed result.

  #|proc:net-operation-result
The `net-operation-result` procedure returns the successful value of `operation`.
The `operation` parameter is a completed network operation.

  #|proc:net-operation-wait
The `net-operation-wait` procedure drives `operation` to a terminal state using blocking poll.
The `operation` parameter is a network operation to advance and wait for.
The return value is the successful operation result; failure conditions are raised.
Poll conditions fail the operation and run cleanup once before the same condition is raised.
It is an error to wait on a cancelled operation.
