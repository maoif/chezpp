  #|record:ssh-session
The `ssh-session` record owns an authenticated or unauthenticated SSH transport.
Host, port, and known-hosts path identify the connection; user changes during authentication.
`ssh-close` releases the handle and all channels, after which session operations raise an error.

  #|record:ssh-channel
The `ssh-channel` record owns one channel retained by its SSH session.
`ssh-close-channel` releases the native handle and marks it closed; closing the owning session also
invalidates it. Operations on a closed channel raise an error.

  #|record:ssh-known-host
An `ssh-known-host` is an immutable parsed known-hosts entry. `hostname` contains the host pattern,
`key-type` contains the SSH key algorithm, `key` contains its base64 data, `comment` contains the
optional trailing text, and `raw` contains the original line. The accessors return those fields.

  #|record:ssh-forwarding
An `ssh-forwarding` owns either a direct channel or a remote listener. `kind` is `local`, `remote`,
or `accepted`; `channel` is an SSH channel or `#f`; `port` is the bound port; `descriptor` is the
pollable SSH descriptor; and `closed?` reports whether the forwarding was closed.

The `ssh-read-stderr!/nonblocking` procedure attempts one stderr read into `bytevector`.
The `channel` parameter is an open SSH channel. The `bytevector` parameter receives bytes.
The optional `start` and `stop` parameters delimit the half-open destination slice.
The return value is a byte count, EOF, or a would-block value naming the SSH descriptor and
its requested transport events.
