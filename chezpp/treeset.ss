  #|macro:define-treeset-procedure
  `(define-treeset-procedure (name fxname) implementation)` defines the generic `name` and fixnum
  `fxname` procedures from one lambda or case-lambda `implementation`. `tree?`, `tree-like`, `fx-`
  `mode`, and `checked` supply the fixed family predicate, constructor, storage mode, and item
  validation. `tree-who` names the procedure and `tree-self` refers to it. `all-family?` and
  `check-family-size` check multiple inputs; arity-specific map checkers validate callback results
  before specialized writes. `tree-size`, `tree-add!`, `tree-clear!`, `tree-list`, and the four
  algebra helpers name same-family APIs.

  respectively.
