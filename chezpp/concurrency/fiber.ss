  ;; The event vocabulary and poll/register/commit protocol follow Concurrent ML:
  ;; https://cml.cs.uchicago.edu/
  ;; The original cvar implementation also compared its API with PCML and Guile
  ;; Fibers. Here a cvar wait explicitly releases and reacquires a caller-owned mutex.
  ;; Guile Fibers reference: https://github.com/wingo/fibers
  ;; Tests adapted from the legacy `fiber.ss.bak` include examples labeled as coming
  ;; from Loko and Guile Fibers benchmarks; see the attribution in `tests/fiber.ss`.

  #|proc:run-fibers
  The `run-fibers` procedure runs `thunk`, a zero-argument procedure, as the init fiber in a new
  context. Init completion or quit stops the context and drops pending child work. All workers
  join before its init values are returned or the first fiber failure is raised to the caller.
  A nested call enqueues `thunk` as a child in the current context and returns an unspecified
  value immediately, without waiting for the nested thunk to finish.
  Optional `worker-count` is the number of OS workers, a positive fixnum defaulting to
  `(cpu-count)`. Optional `quantum` is a fixnum of at least 100 Scheme timer ticks per slice;
  it defaults to 30000. Smaller budgets cannot reliably advance past scheduler dispatch and
  are rejected before any workers start. Ticks measure Scheme work, not wall-clock time. A larger
  quantum favors throughput at the cost of wakeup latency. Both settings are captured for
  the lifetime of a new context; nested calls keep their parent's scheduler configuration.
  A call on a separate OS thread creates its own context, including threads forked by a fiber.

  The `event-wrap` procedure returns a new event wrapping `event`, leaving `event` unchanged.
  After synchronization, procedure receives all event result values as its arguments and its
  return values become the synchronization results. Repeated wrappers run in construction order.

  With no arguments, it returns a disabled event equivalent to `(event-never)`.
